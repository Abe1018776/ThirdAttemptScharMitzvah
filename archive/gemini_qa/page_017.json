  "raw_response": "Analysis of the page reveals a critical finding regarding the layout and reading order that contradics the initial OCR parsing.\n\n**Page Structure & Reading Order:**\n1.  **Page Number:** The header shows `לו` (36). This is a verso (left-side) page. In Hebrew books, verso pages have the **Right Column as the Inner/First** column and **Left Column as the Outer/Second** column.\n2.  **Visual Sequence Check:**\n    *   **Right Column (First):**\n        *   Top text starts: \"מצוה שלימה...\" (Continuation from previous page).\n        *   Section Header: Clearly marked **לג** (33). Title: \"המסיק שמעתתא...\".\n        *   Section Header: **לד** (34). Title: \"מי שהוא שמח...\".\n        *   Section Header: **לה** (35). Title: \"מי שעמל בתורה...\".\n        *   Bottom text of Section 35: \"חנו (אנו) שכבר ידוע לנו ההלכה...\".\n    *   **Left Column (Second):**\n        *   Top text starts: \"פסוקה, אמנם...\" (Completes the phrase \"הלכה פסוקה\" from the Right Column bottom).\n        *   Section Header: Visually looks like **לא** (31), but logically must be **לו** (36) following 35. The letter *Aleph* (א) and *Vav* (ו) can look confusing in some fonts, but look at the second header below it.\n        *   Section Header: Visually looks like **לב** (32), but logically must be **לז** (37). Visually it acts like *Bet*.\n        *   *Correction Note:* The OCR identified these as 31 and 32. However, the reading flow is indisputably Right (33-35) -> Left (Continuation -> Next Sections). If the OCR keeps the visual numbers \"31\" and \"32\" appearing *after* \"35\", it indicates a printing error or non-standard numbering in the source book, but the **content flow** is Right->Left. The OCR's current JSON presents \"31, 32\" (Left col) *after* \"35\" (Right col) if we order by column, but the OCR's JSON *array order* placed the Left column sections (33? no it labeled Left as 33/34/35 in correctly) mixed with Right.\n\n**Addressing the OCR Result's Major Failure:**\nThe OCR returned an almost completely scrambled structure.\n- It identified the **Right** column sections as **31, 32** (Wait, no: it identified the *Right* column sections as 33, 34, 35 in the data, but labeled the *Left* column text",
